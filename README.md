NicCage
=======

NicCage is a data binding library for Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android using convention over configuration.

We are in the process of creating the project and porting over our proof of concept from this [repo](https://github.com/Hitcents/XamBind). We will publish a release when a version is ready for primetime use.
